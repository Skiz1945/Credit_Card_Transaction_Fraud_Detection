Insights:
Even among cardholders with more than 100 transactions, fraud rates remain elevated in high-risk categories,

/*
Key Observations:
- Merchant-Specific Risks: Certain merchants (e.g., fraud_Kerluke-Abshire) 
show extremely high fraud rates during late-night hours, 
indicating potential fraud rings or merchant vulnerabilities.
- Age-Related Vulnerability: Older cardholders (60+) face significantly higher fraud rates during peak fraud hours, 
suggesting targeted exploitation.
- High-Frequency Cardholders: Frequent transactors still face notable fraud risks in high-risk categories, 
though their rates are lower overall.
