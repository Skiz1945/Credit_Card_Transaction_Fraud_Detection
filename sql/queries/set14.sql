Insights:
The 100% fraud rates suggest these merchants are either highly vulnerable during late-night, 
high-value transactions or involved in targeted attacks. Low transaction counts indicate potential outliers rather than systemic fraud hubs.

Analyze merchants in the shopping_net category, another high-risk area, to compare with grocery_pos.

Insights:
The 60+ age group is disproportionately targeted in shopping_net, with fraud rates 6â€“7 times the average, 
pointing to vulnerabilities in online transactions for older cardholders.
